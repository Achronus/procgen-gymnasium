## Description

The player must steal the gem hidden behind a network of locks. Each lock comes in one of three colours, and the necessary keys to open these locks are scattered throughout the level. The level layout takes the form of a maze, generated by Kruskal's algorithm. Once the player collects a key of a certain colour, the player may open the lock of that colour. All keys in the player's possession are shown in the top right corner of the screen.

## Action Space

The environment uses a `Discrete(15)` action space representing combinations of directional and button inputs:

| Action | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | LEFT + DOWN |
| 1 | LEFT |
| 2 | LEFT + UP |
| 3 | DOWN |
| 4 | (no-op) |
| 5 | UP |
| 6 | RIGHT + DOWN |
| 7 | RIGHT |
| 8 | RIGHT + UP |
| 9 | D |
| 10 | A |
| 11 | W |
| 12 | S |
| 13 | Q |
| 14 | E |

## Observation Space

The observation is an RGB image of shape `(64, 64, 3)` with pixel values in `[0, 255]` (`uint8`). By default, observations are centered on the agent.

## Rewards

The player receives a reward for collecting the gem.

## Episode End

The episode ends when the player collects the gem.

## Distribution Modes

Supports `"easy"` and `"hard"` modes. Also supports `"exploration"` mode.

## Usage

```python
import gymnasium as gym
import procgen_gymnasium

# Single environment
env = gym.make("procgen_gym/procgen-heist-v0")

# Vectorized
env = gym.make_vec("procgen_gym/procgen-heist-v0", num_envs=16)
```
