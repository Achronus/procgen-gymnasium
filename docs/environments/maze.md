|   |   |
|---|---|
| **Action Space** | `Discrete(15)` |
| **Observation Space** | `Box(0, 255, (64, 64, 3), uint8)` |
| **Import** | `gymnasium.make("procgen:procgen-maze-v0")` |

## Description

The player, a mouse, must navigate a maze to find the sole piece of cheese and earn a reward. Mazes are generated by Kruskal's algorithm and range in size from 3x3 to 25x25. The maze dimensions are uniformly sampled over this range. The player may move up, down, left or right to navigate the maze.

## Action Space

The environment uses a `Discrete(15)` action space representing combinations of directional and button inputs:

| Action | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | LEFT + DOWN |
| 1 | LEFT |
| 2 | LEFT + UP |
| 3 | DOWN |
| 4 | (no-op) |
| 5 | UP |
| 6 | RIGHT + DOWN |
| 7 | RIGHT |
| 8 | RIGHT + UP |
| 9 | D |
| 10 | A |
| 11 | W |
| 12 | S |
| 13 | Q |
| 14 | E |

## Observation Space

The observation is an RGB image of shape `(64, 64, 3)` with pixel values in `[0, 255]` (`uint8`). By default, observations are centered on the agent.

## Rewards

The player receives a reward for finding the cheese.

## Episode End

The episode ends when the player finds the cheese.

## Distribution Modes

Supports `"easy"` and `"hard"` modes. Also supports `"exploration"` mode.

## Usage

```python
import gymnasium
import procgen_gymnasium

# Single environment
env = gymnasium.make("procgen:procgen-maze-v0")

# Vectorized
env = gymnasium.make_vec("procgen:procgen-maze-v0", num_envs=16)
```
